name: White Bean & Sage Dip
ingredients:
  - name: canellini beans
    description: one can canellini beans, drained and rinsed
  - name: olive oil
    description: 6 tbsp olive oil + extra for frying sage leaves
  - name: garlic
    description: two garlic cloves
  - name: dijon mustard
    description: 3/4 tsp dijon mustard
  - name: red wine vinegar
    description: 2 tbsp red wine vinegar
  - name: sage leaves
    description: a lot of fresh sage leaves
  - name: salt
    description: 3/4 tsp of salt
  - name: pepper
    description: 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper

instructions:
  - Heat some olive oil in a small sauce pan on medium heat.  Add sage leaves and fry until they are crispy.

  - Add the fried sage leaves along with all of the other ingredients *except the olive oil* into a blender.  Blend until things start to combine, and then slowly pour in the olive oil.

notes: >
  The original recipe called for 6 sage leaves.  I usually use a lot more than that, like two dozen.


  I am not positive how much olive oil I used, just keep streaming it into the blender until things get to the consistency you want.
