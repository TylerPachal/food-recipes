instructions:
  - Coat the bottom of a large pot with oil and place over medium heat. When oil is hot, add onion, carrots, celery and garlic. Sauté until veggies are softened, about 5 minutes.
  - Add broth, peas, curry powder, garam masala and cumin. Bring to a boil. Lower heat and allow to simmer until peas are very soft, about 30 minutes.
  - Scoop soup mixture and purée in a blender.  You may have to do this in batches if the blender is not large enough for the whole pot.  Return puréed mixture to pot.
  - Stir in coconut milk and lemon or lime juice, if using. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

notes: >
  I only cooked for 20 minutes and the lentils still had a bit of a bite to them.  Trying 30 minutes next time.


  I added some other miscellaneous veggies from the fridge: one jalapeño and some brocoli.
