ingredients:
  - name: brown lentils
    description: 1 cup dried green or brown lentils
  - name: greek yogurt
    description: 1/2 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt
  - name: lemon
    description: 1/4 tsp. finely grated lemon zest & 1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
  - name: garlic
    description: 2 garlic cloves, finely grated, divided
  - name: salt
    description: Kosher salt
  - name: crimini mushrooms
    description: 6 oz. crimini mushrooms, stems trimmed
  - name: miso
    description: 2 Tbsp. white miso
  - name: paprika
    description: 1/4 tsp. smoked paprika
  - name: olive oil
    description: 4 Tbsp. (or more) extra-virgin olive oil, divided
  - name: flour
    description: 1/4 cup (or more) oat, gluten-free 1:1 blend, or all-purpose flour
  - name: buns
    description: Whole wheat buns
  - name: condiments
    description: sprouts and/or lettuce, and sliced pickles (for serving)

instructions:
  - Pour water into a large saucepan to cover lentils by 4". Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until lentils are tender but not mushy, about 10 minutes from the time the water reaches a boil. Drain very well in a fine-mesh sieve, then let cool at least 10 minutes (spread them out on a baking sheet, which will help them cool faster).
  - Meanwhile, combine yogurt, lemon zest, lemon juice, and half of garlic in a small bowl. Season with salt; set aside.
  - Finely chop mushrooms and transfer to a medium bowl. Add miso, paprika, 2 Tbsp. oil, and remaining garlic clove. Add lentils (you should have 2 cups cooked) and stir and mash them with the back of a spoon or a potato masher until lentils are partly mashed but with lots of whole lentils still remaining. Vigorously stir in flour until mixture holds together when squeezed; if it doesn't, continue to mash until it does and add 1â€“2 Tbsp. flour if needed. Form into 6 patties about 3/4" thick.
  - Working in 2 batches, heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet (nonstick is essential since these will definitely stick to a regular skillet) over medium. Cook patties until deeply browned and very crisp on bottom side, about 3 minutes. Carefully turn and repeat on second side, adding more oil as needed to maintain a light coating around patties in skillet.
  - Spread reserved yogurt mixture on buns. Top with burgers, sprouts, and pickles.
  - Patties can be made 4 days ahead. Tightly wrap in plastic and chill.

notes: >
  I never had much luck with the patties sticking together "well".  I found that I preferred to make thinner patties and get them crispy in the pan as as sort of pancake and eat them with mustard.
