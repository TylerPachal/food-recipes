description: One of Ethiopia’s most popular vegetarian dishes, Misir Wat showcases lentils in a way that’s unlike any you’ve had before.  The flavor is simply out of this world!
ingredients:
  - name: butter
    description: 4 tbsp butter, divided
  - name: onion
    description: 1 large yellow onion, very finely diced
  - name: garlic
    description: 3 cloves garlic, finely minced
  - name: tomato
    description: 1 Roma tomato, very finely chopped
  - name: tomato paste
    description: 3 tablespoons tomato paste
  - name: bebere
    description: 2 tablespoons bebere, divided
  - name: red lentils
    description: 1 1/3 cups split red lentils
  - name: chicken broth
    description: 2 1/2 cups chicken broth
  - name: salt
    description: 1 tsp salt

instructions:
  - Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in a medium stock pot.  Add the onions and cook over medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes until golden brown.
  - Add the garlic, tomatoes, tomato paste and 1 tablespoon of the berbere and cook for 5-7 minutes. Reduce the heat if needed to prevent burning.
  - Add the lentils, broth, and salt, bring it to a boil, reduce the heat to low and cover and simmer the lentils, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes adding more broth if needed or until the lentils are soft.
  - Stir in the remaining tablespoon of butter and berbere. Simmer for a couple more minutes. Add salt to taste.

notes: >
  The original recipe call for red lentils but I have only ever seen **split** red lentils in the grocery store.  These aren't as big and cook much faster, I have adjusted the recipe accordingly.


  I have used diced canned tomatoes (a third of a can or so) in place of the roma tomatoe.
