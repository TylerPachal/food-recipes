name: Kale Pesto Pasta
source: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/kale-pesto-with-whole-wheat-pasta
ingredients:
  - section: Pesto
  - name: kale
    description: 1 large bunch kale, ribs and stems removed
  - name: cashews
    description: 1/3 cup raw cashews
  - name: garlic
    description: 1 garlic clove
  - name: parmesan
    description: 1 oz. parmesan
  - name: kosher salt

  - section: Pasta
  - name: pasta
    description: 12 oz. farro pasta or whole wheat pasta
  - name: butter
    description: 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter
  - name: freshly ground black pepper

instructions:
  - Cook kale leaves in a large pot of boiling salted water until bright green and wilted, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet with tongs; keep water boiling. Let kale cool slightly; wring out excess water with your hands.

  - Cook pasta in pot of boiling water, stirring occasionally, until al dente.

  - Blend nuts, oil, garlic, and ⅓ cup water in a blender or food processor until very smooth. Add kale and 1 oz. Parmesan. Purée, adding water 1 Tbsp. at a time as needed, until smooth (it took me at least four or five tablespoons). Transfer pesto to a large bowl.

  - Using tongs, transfer pasta to bowl with pesto; add butter and ⅓ cup pasta cooking liquid. Toss, adding more pasta cooking liquid by the tablespoonful if needed, until sauce coats pasta. Divide among bowls; top with more Parmesan and a few grinds of pepper.

notes: >
  Original recipe called for pistachios but I used cashews.
