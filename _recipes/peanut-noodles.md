instructions:
  - In a large bowl, whisk together peanut butter, soy sauce, garlic, honey, ginger, vinegar, sesame and oil; set aside.
  - In a large pot of boiling water, cook noodles.
  - Remove noodles from water and add to the large bowl with the sauce from Step 1; this will help melt the peanut butter.  Mix well.
  - Divide the noodles, top with green onion, chopped peanutes, sesame seeds, and a dollop of the chili crisp oil.

notes: >
  I have ommitted the carrot and cabbage.


  In the future I would like to add tofu, in that case, cooking the tofu in a skillet with the sauce would be best.
