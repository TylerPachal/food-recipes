  - name: cheese
    description: 4 ounces (1 cup) grated cheese

instructions:
    - Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
    - Slice the sweet potatoes in half lengthwise and coat the flat sides lightly with olive oil. Place the sweet potatoes flat-side down on a baking sheet. Bake until they’re tender and cooked through, about 30 to 35 minutes. Leave the oven on, since we’ll bake the assembled enchiladas soon (no temperature adjustments necessary).
    - Meanwhile, pour enough salsa verde into a 9 by 13-inch baking dish to lightly cover the bottom (about 1/2 cup). In a medium mixing bowl, combine all of the remaining filling ingredients.
    - Once the sweet potatoes are cooked through and cool enough to handle, scoop out the insides with a spoon. Discard the potato skins, and lightly mash the sweet potatoes with a fork or the back of a spoon.
    - Stir the mashed sweet potato into the bowl of filling, and season to taste with additional salt  and pepper.
    - Warm up your tortillas, one by one in a skillet, or all at once in a microwave so they don’t break when you bend them. Wrap them in a clean tea towel so they stay warm.  I microwaved them for a minute.
    - Working with one tortilla at a time, spread about 1/2 cup filling down the center each tortilla, then wrap both sides over the filling and place it in your baking dish. Repeat for all of the tortillas.
    - Top with the remaining salsa verde and cheese. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until sauce is bubbling and the cheese is lightly golden.
    - Let the enchiladas cool for about 5 minutes. Whisk the sour cream and water together to make a drizzly sour cream sauce. Drizzle it back and forth over the enchiladas, then top them with cilantro and red onion. Serve.

notes: >
  One pack of small corn tortillas was perfect for 9" X 13" glass dish (three rows of five).
