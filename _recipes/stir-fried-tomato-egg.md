instructions:
  - Prep Stir-Fried Tomato Mixture.  Cut tomatoes into bite-sized chunks.  Cut green onion stalks into thin pieces.  Get an empty bowl ready, we will be removing the tomato mixture from the wok to cook the eggs.
  - Add salt and sugar to a small bowl.
  - Get a 1/4 of water ready.
  - Prep Egg Mixture.  Crack eggs into a bowl. Beat until homogenious.
  - Prep Slurry.  Mix corn starch and water in a bowl.
  - Stir-Fry Tomatoes.  Coat sides of wok with Vegetable Oil (2 Tablespoon). Place on medium-high heat.  Once oil is hot, swirl the oil around to coat and then add in the tomato chunks, salt, and sugar.  Stir-fry for 1 minute, then add in Ketchup, 1/4 cup of Water, and green onion.  Once it comes back up to a boil, give the starch mixture another quick stir, then add to wok and stir everything until sauce thickens. Turn off the heat and place the tomato mixture into a separate bowl.  Add sesame oil.
  - Quickly wash the wok and dry it off with a paper towel.
  - Stir-fry Egg Mixture.  Add 2 Tablespoons of cooking oil into the wok. Place on medium-high heat.
    Once the oil is hot, swirl the oil around to coat the wok and add in the beaten eggs. After 10 seconds - the egg will start to set at the edges. Immediately, add in the stir-fried tomato mixture while the eggs are still very runny.  Gently fold the egg that have set at the edges, inwards - into the tomatoes. Repeat this step - this will make large, fluffy egg curds.  Cook until egg gets to desired consistency (very quick).
  - Serve on rice, top with chili crisps.

notes: >
  This makes plenty for one person.  To make more, use 5 eggs and 3 tomatoes.
