ingredients:
  - name: tofu
    description: one block of firm tofu
  - name: flour
    description: 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
  - name: cayenne
    description: 1 tsp cayenne pepper
  - name: garlic poweder
    description: 2 tsp garlic powder
  - name: egg
    description: 1 large egg
  - name: panko
    description: 2 cups panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)

instructions:
  - Slice and press tofu for 15 minutes to remove moisture.

  - Bring a few cups of water and 1/3 cup of salt to a boil.  Once boiling, remove from heat and add tofu.

  - Combine flour, cayenne, garlic powder, and remaining salt in a medium bowl.

  - Whisk egg in another medium bowl.

  - Place panko on a large plate.

  - Working one at a time, dip tofu into flour dredge, turning to coat. Shake off any excess. Dip into egg mixture until coated, shaking off excess. Dredge in panko, turning to coat. Transfer to a large plate or a small rimmed baking sheet.

  - Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Test oil by putting a piece of panko - it shouble bubble.  Working in batches, cook tofu until golden and very crisp on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack or paper towel.

notes: >
  Original recipe was for a [hot chicken sandwhich](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/spicy-chicken-katsu-sandwiches) on Bon Appetit.  The first two steps are for prepping the tofu to replace the chicken and the other steps are copied from the chicken sandwhich recipe.


  The Bon Appetit recipe calls for extra cayenne and hot sauce which I did not add for my katsu purposes.
