instructions:
  - For the rolls, dissolve the yeast in the warm milk with a tsp of sugar (you can take a tsp out of the 1/2 cup of sugar) in a large bowl. Let it sit for about 5 minutes. If the yeast is good, it will start to froth up.
  - To the bowl of your mixer add the sugar, butter or margarine, salt, eggs, and flour and mix until well incorporated.
  - Pour the milk/yeast mixture over the flour mixture and using the dough hook, mix well until well incorporated.
  - Place the dough into an oiled bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.
  - Combine the brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.
  - Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray or butter.
  - Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface, until it is approximately 16 inches long by 12 inches wide. It should be approximately 1/4 inch in thickness.
  - Spread the 1/3 cup of butter evenly over the dough, then sprinkle with the sugar evenly over the surface of the dough.
  - Working carefully, from the long edge, roll the dough down to the bottom edge.
  - Cut the dough into 1 1/2 inch slices, and place in a lightly greased baking pan. You can also use floss to cut into slices, as seen in the video. Place the cut rolls in the prepared pan. Cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let them rise for another 30 minutes, or until doubled in size.
  - Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  - Place the baking pan in the oven and bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cooking time can vary greatly!
  - While the rolls are baking make the icing by mixing all the icing ingredients and beat well with an electric mixer until fluffy and smooth.
  - When the rolls are done, spread generously with icing.


notes: >
  Keep an eye on rolls while in the oven - original recipe said 20 minutes baking time, but ~25 did the trick the last time!


  This makes about 12 medium-sized cinnamon rolls.
