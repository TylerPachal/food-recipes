ingredients:
  - name: olive oil
    description: 1 tbsp olive oil
  - name: red onion
    description: 1 large red onion, thinly sliced
  - name: garlic
    description: 3 garlic cloves, grated
  - name: ginger
    description: 1 inch fresh ginger, peeled and grated
  - name: garam masala
    description: 1 tbsp garam masala
  - name: turmeric
    description: 1/4 tsp ground turmeric
  - name: black pepper
    description: 1/4 tsp black pepper
  - name: cayenne pepper
    description: 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
  - name: canned tomatoes
    description: one 14-oz can of tomatoes (crushed or diced)
  - name: chickpeas
    description: one 16-oz can of cooked chickpeas
  - name: coconut milk
    description: one 14-oz can of coconut milk (shake well)
  - name: lime juice
    description: 2 tbsp lime juice

instructions:
  - In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the red onion with a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is softened and starting to brown.
  - Reduce the heat to medium. Add the garlic and ginger; stir and cook for 60 seconds or until fragrant. Stir in the garam masala, turmeric, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and salt. Cook for 30 seconds more to toast the spices.
  - Add the tomatoes to the pan and stir well. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3-5 minutes or until the tomatoes are starting to break down and dry up a little bit. Stir in the coconut milk and chickpeas. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low.
  - Simmer the coconut chickpea curry for about 10 minutes or until reduced slightly. Stir in the fresh lime juice. Season to taste with additional salt (I used about another 1/2 teaspoon at this point). Serve hot, over rice or other accompaniments of choice, and garnished with chopped fresh cilantro.

notes: >
  Added spinach after things were done simmering.


  This only makes about four servings.  Next time I would double everything.
