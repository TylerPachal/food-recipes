    description: 1/2 tsp onion powder
  - name: salt
    description: 3/4 tsp salt
  - name: ground pepper

  - section: bread crumbs
  - name: bread
    description: 2-3 slices of bread, ends work best
  - name: garlic powder
    description: 1 tsp garlic powder
  - name: paprika
    description: 1/4 tsp smoked paprika
  - name: olive oil
    description: 1 tbsp olive oil

instructions:
  - Fill a large pot about halfway with water and bring to a boil.  Once boiling, salt the water.
  - Prepare potato and cauliflower and add to boiling salted water.  Bring back to a boil and reduce heat to medium.  Cook until the potatoes and cauliflower are tender.
  - In the mean time, add all bread crumb ingredients to a blender and pulse until quite fine.  Transfer to non-stick pan and toast on low/medium heat, tossing occasionally.
  - Once the potatoes and cauliflower are tender, strain the vegetables and transfer to blender and blend with corn starch until a smooth thick paste forms. The heat from the vegetables will help activate the starch.
  - Once blended into a thick paste, add the rest of your ingredients (except the black pepper) and blend again until completely smooth. Add pepper to taste. Place into a large bowl (that will also have room for the pasta).
  - In the same pot used for boiling the potatoes, prepare the pasta as instructed on the label.
  - Drain your pasta and while still piping hot, transfer it to the bowl with your "cheese" sauce.  Gently fold together until completely combined.
  - Transfer pasta into a well oiled 8x8 pan and evenly sprinkle the breadcrumb topping over the mac n' cheese. Set your oven to medium broil.
  - Insert the dish into the oven and broil until the breadcrumbs are golden brown. Watch closely!
