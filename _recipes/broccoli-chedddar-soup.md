    description: 4 cups vegetable or chicken broth

  - name: pepper
    description: 1/2 tsp pepper
  - name: cashews
    description: 3/4 cup cashews
  - name: spinach
    description: 1–2 large handful baby spinach

instructions:
  - Heat oil in a big pot over medium heat, and add the onion, garlic, poblanos and jalapeno, stirring occasionally, letting the onions get golden, about 5 minutes.
  - Add the broccoli, broth, water, bay leaf, coriander, oregano, salt, and pepper. The liquid should just cover the veggies. Cover, bring to a boil, turn heat down and simmer gently until broccoli is tender, about 10-12. minutes. Turn heat off and remove bay leaf.
  - Place roughly 2 cups of the broccoli and 2 cups of broth into a blender. Add the cashews and 3 tablespoons nutritional yeast.
  - Blend until silky smooth.  Keep middle lid plug off to let steam escape.
  - To the blender, add 1-2 big handfuls of fresh baby spinach and blend until fully incorporated and smooth.
  - Pour this back in the broccoli soup pot, mix and heat gently over low heat, careful not to boil or simmer too long, or you will lose the lovely vibrant green color.
  - Taste for salt, heat, and acid. Add a little squeeze of lime if you like, or extra chili flakes or more pepper.
