description: The best stovetop sticky rice in a heavy pot.

ingredients:
  - name: rice
  - name: water

instructions:
  - With a ratio of 1:1, place rice and water in a pot with a heavy lid.  Heat on medium heat until first bubbles appear.

  - Once bubbles appear, reduce heat to just-above-low and cover for 15 minutes.  Do not remove lid.

  - After 15 minutes is up, turn off the heat and leave the lid on for another 10 minutes to continue to steam the rice.  Do not remove lid.

  - After the 10 minutes is up, fluff rice with a fork and serve.

notes: >
  Kenji says that rinsing rice is not neccesary, so I did not bother to do it here.
